### Project Overview

 Problem statement

Let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.



### Learnings from the project

 fter completing this project, we will have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split

Correlation between the features

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regressor

Lasso Regressor

Ridge Regressor
