### Project Overview

 Problem statement

We will be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that we can budget it from your revenue.This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Our aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.




### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.
